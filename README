Python implementation of game of Yahtzee with a rudimentary system for training
a computer AI using reinforcement learning. A game can be run by executing the
yg at the command line. A computer can be trained by editing and running the
train* methods in yrl, although these are currently slow and generate
relatively large files. Files:

  dice_set : Representation of a set of dice
  rl : Basic reinforcement learning functions
  ys : How to score dice in Yahtzee and track scoring in a game
  ya : Actions that a player can take in Yahtzee
  yrl : Functions for running reinforcement learning for Yahtzee
  yg : For running game of Yahtzee
